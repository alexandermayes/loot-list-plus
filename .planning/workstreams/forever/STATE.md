# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (shared; its milestone section describes the SEO sprint, not this milestone)
Milestone brief: `.planning/workstreams/forever/MILESTONE-BRIEF.md`
Requirements: `.planning/workstreams/forever/REQUIREMENTS.md` (44 v1)
Roadmap: `.planning/workstreams/forever/ROADMAP.md` (8 phases)
Research: `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md`

**Core value:** A Forever guild can run loot from day one without knowing a single item: raiders rank generic needs, officers settle every drop in seconds from a Drop Desk, and the whole product feels like a consumer app that just works.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Forever Defect and Privacy Fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Forever Defect and Privacy Fixes) — EXECUTING
Plan: 5 of 9
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-13 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0/8 phases ([░░░░░░░░░░] 0%)

## Hard Dates

- 2026-10-31: Discovery lists usable (Phases 1 to 4)
- 2026-11-30: Drop Desk live (Phases 5 to 7)
- 2026-12-09: Forever raids open (Phase 8 cuts targeted around it)

## Standing Constraints

1. Schema changes are expand-only, ship as their own migration-only PR (`--admin` merge, non-raid day) and are live before any code that reads them; RLS matrix per new table.
2. The owner signs off user-facing copy; no em dashes in user-facing text.
3. No player or guild names in analytics or published data.
4. Known guilds' Loot Score golden fixtures and Lua fixtures stay byte-identical.
5. No live wago.tools or Wowhead fetches; nothing before Dec 9 depends on Forever loot data.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Owner: all four extra features are in (What would it take line, who's-interested responses, live Discord loot thread, loot style presets).
- Owner: the Drop Desk is free for all guilds, gated by a server-side guild setting.
- Owner: need rows are per raid tier, with one picker fanning out to every Discovery tier.
- Owner: the simplicity audit starts Oct 26; its cuts ship after Nov 30.
- Owner: the Known mode transition is deferred; raid assignments are out of scope.
- Roadmap: the research's ranker-extraction phase is folded into Phase 5, and the Drop Desk is split into Phase 5 (core award path) and Phase 6 (live raid night).
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: BLP recompute is awaited (not after()) on award DELETE and PATCH reassign; unlinking to null also recomputes — Success criterion 1 says by the time the request returns; recomputeBlpForItems returns RPC errors without throwing
- [Phase 01]: 01-01: award receipt whitelist is Record<keyof ScoreComponents, true>; cap stays JSON.stringify length (UTF-16 units) at 4096 — A new score component is a compile error until whitelisted; changing the cap unit is outside FIX-04 (assumption A9)
- [Phase 01]: Owner decision 7: a failed loot_history read in guild-data answers 500 like every other read (route throws; member-ranked-items unchanged) — A failed read must never be presented as a complete list
- [Phase 01]: guild-data pages loot_items too and reads loot_submissions oldest first (created_at, id) so the newest approved submission wins — MoP catalogs pass 1700 items; the old read had no ORDER BY so the winner was unspecified
- [Phase 01]: createTypedServiceRoleClient delegates to createServiceRoleClient; selectAllPagesOrThrow exported from utils/supabase/paginate.ts for plans 01-04, 01-05, 01-07 — Existing test mocks of createServiceRoleClient keep working
- [Phase 01]: 01-03: wowheadItemUrl matches the stored expansion name exactly; Forever links to wowhead.com/forever, every other guild keeps its existing link (owner decision 2) — Forever-only scope keeps known guilds byte-identical; the helper keeps the era map so era-correct links are a one-line opt-in per call site (deferred follow-up)
- [Phase 01]: 01-06: master_loot_awarded reports loot_item_ids (ids only, list order); a failed item read is null (unknown), never zero; guild_name unregistered; posthog.identify drops email and display_name — Owner decisions 1 and 4 and Hard Constraint 3; null keeps a failed read from posing as an empty list

### Pending Owner Inputs

- Oct 21: Forever boss names (Phase 2); addon scope and owner for the separate repo (Phase 5)
- Oct 26: spec defaults review and copy sign-off for picker, presets, "Set your 5" (Phase 4); simplicity audit scope and sidebar direction (Phase 8)
- Nov 9: beta guild, named paper-fallback officer, void rule (Phase 7); master loot or Gargul export scope (Phase 5)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: research lists two cost schemes for need rows (an allocation cost of 1/1/0, and a budget at Big 3, Medium 2, Standard 1). Settle which one the seeded rows carry before Phase 4 reads it.
- Phase 3 to 4 gap: a Discovery tier can have need rows before raiders have a picker.
- Research flags: Phases 3, 5, 6 and 8 need `/gsd-plan-phase N --research-phase`.
